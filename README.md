# Contrasim-Game

This repository contains [Isabelle2020](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/website-Isabelle2020/index.html) formulations proving the soundness and correctness of two game-theoretical characterizations of the contrasimulation preorder.

All files beginning with `Montanari_` are completely my own. 
All other files are taken from [Bisping's Isabelle2018 formulation for his Coupled Similarity Game](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.7831382.v1) with the author's permission.

With one exception, Bisping's files remain unmodified. However, in the file `Weak_Relations_modified.thy` the entire section concerning contrasimulation was removed.
