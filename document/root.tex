\noindent
This theory surveys and extends characterizations of \emph{coupled similarity} and \emph{contrasimilarity},
and proves properties relevant for algorithms computing their simulation preorders and equivalences.

Coupled similarity and contrasimilarity are two weak forms of bisimilarity for systems with
internal behavior.
They have outstanding applications in contexts where internal choices must transparently be
distributed in time or space, for example, in process calculi encodings or in action refinements.

Our key contribution is to characterize the coupled simulation and contrasimulation preorders by \emph{reachability games}.
We also show how the preexisting definitions coincide and that they can be reformulated using \emph{coupled delay simulations}.
We moreover verify a polynomial-time coinductive fixed-point algorithm computing the coupled simulation preorder.
Through reduction proofs, we establish that deciding coupled similarity is at least as complex
as computing weak similarity; and that contrasimilarity checking is at least as hard as trace inclusion
checking.

\section{Introduction}

Coupled similarity and contrasimilarity are among the weakest abstractions of bisimilarity for systems
with silent steps presented in van Glabbeek's \emph{linear-time--branching-time spectrum}~\cite{glabbeek1993ltbt}.
In particular, they are \emph{weaker than weak bisimilarity} in that they impose a weaker form of
symmetry on the bisimulation link between compared states; coupled similarity implies
contrasimilarity~\cite{bnp2020coupledsim32}. They are weak bisimilarities, however, in the sense
that, on systems with no internal behavior, they coincide with strong bisimilarity.

This theory contains the Isabelle formalization for two related lines of publication:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Computing coupled similarity:} Benjamin Bisping and Uwe Nestmann's TACAS 2019 paper~%
    \cite{bn2019coupledsimTacas} and Bisping's master thesis~\cite{bisping2018coupledsim},
    which can be found on \url{https://coupledsim.bbisping.de/bisping_computingCoupledSimilarity_thesis.pdf},
    establish the first decision procedures for coupled similarity checking.
    This is done through a game-based approach.
    Also, the work introduces the idea that $\tau$-sinks can be used to reduce from weak simulation
    preorder to coupled simulation preorder.
  \item \emph{Game characterization of contrasimilarity:} Benjamin Bisping and Luisa Montanari's
    EXPRESS/SOS 2021 paper~\cite{bm2021contrasimilarity} and Montanari's bachelor thesis provide
    the first game characterization of contrasimilarity.
    The present Isabelle theory extends this work by also showing a reduction from weak trace preorder to
    contrasimulation preorder and by linking the game to a modal characterization of contrasimilarity.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Combined, the results establish a slope of complexity between weak bisimilarity, coupled similarity,
and contrasimilarity with the equivalence problems becoming harder for coarser equivalences.
See Figure~\ref{fig:equivalences} for a graphical representation.

The modal characterization of contrasimilarity at the end of this theory gives a nice intuition
for why contrasimilarity is a sensible weakening for bisimilarity. We show that the following
Hennessy--Milner logic (with $\langle \varepsilon \rangle$ denoting places of possible internal
behavior) characterizes contrasimilarity.
\[
  \varphi  ::= \quad \langle \varepsilon \rangle \langle a\rangle \varphi
    \quad \mid \quad \langle \varepsilon \rangle \bigwedge_{i \in I} \neg \varphi_i
       \qquad \text{(with $a \neq \tau$).}
\]
It is a ``nice'' abstraction of strong bisimilarity, since it can be obtained from the following
complete fragment of Hennessy--Milner logic by inserting places for unobservable behavior in front of
each constructor.
\[
    \varphi  ::= \quad \langle a \rangle \varphi
      \quad \mid \quad \bigwedge_{i \in I} \neg \varphi_i .
\]
This modal formulation is important for a unified algorithmic treatment of weak behavioral equivalences
in~\cite{bj2023ltbtsSilentSteps}.
