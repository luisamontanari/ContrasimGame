These bisimulation relations preserve CSP semantics, as well as the operational semantics of programs in other languages with operational semantics described by such GLTSs and relying only on observational equivalence. They can therefore be used to combat the space explosion problem faced in explicit model checking for such languages. We concentrate on algorithms which work efficiently when implemented rather than on ones which have low asymptotic growth.},

It is obtained by taking a semantic equivalence from the linear time â€“ branching time spectrum, namely divergence-preserving coupled similarity, and showing that it is a congruence for the operators of CSP. This equivalence belongs to the bisimulation family of semantic equivalences, in the sense that on transi- tion systems without internal actions it coincides with strong bisimilarity. Nevertheless, enough of the equational laws of CSP remain to obtain a complete axiomatisation for closed, recursion-free terms.},

We try to answer this question by describing two general methods that can be used to construct direct one-to-one polynomial-time reductions from bisimulation equivalence to simulation preorder (and simulation equivalence). These methods can be applied to many classes of finitely generated transition systems, provided that they satisfy certain abstractly formulated conditions. Roughly speaking, our first method works for all classes of systems that can test for `non-enabledness' of actions, while our second method works for all classes of systems that are closed under synchronization.},

  abstract    = {Discrete- and continuous-time Markov chains as well as interactive
	Markov chains are widely used model classes for the analysis of
	stochastic systems. A fundamental problem thereby is the number of
	states, which in general grows exponentially in the size of the
	corresponding high-level model.\par
	In this work we develop two methods to cope with this problem. The
	first one consists of the computation of a system with a minimal
	number of states and the same observable behavior as the original
	system. This allows us to carry out any analysis with well-known
	algorithms on the minimal system. Depending on the definition of
	observability we obtain different minimal systems. Our algorithm is
	able to handle a large number system types and minimization criteria
	which are considered practically relevant in the literature. Our
	method works with symbolic data structures and dedicated operations
	thereon whose runtime only depends on the size of the representation
	instead of the size of the represented system. The size of the
	symbolic representation of many real-world systems, however, is
	smaller by orders of magnitudes than the system itself. Experimental
	results prove the efficiency of our algorithm.\par
	The other method to handle large state spaces is to develop algorithms
	which are directly applicable to large systems. For the refutation of
	safety properties in digital circuits a method called Bounded Model
	Checking has been developed, which is nowadays successfully applied
	also in industry. We show how Bounded Model Checking can be adapted to
	compute counterexamples for discrete-time Markov chains if a given
	safety property is violated. By a number of optimization technique we
	can reduce not only the runtime but also the size of the
	counterexamples. The result is a method which is able to handle
	significantly larger systems than the previously available algorithms.},

Ein grundlegendes Problem bei ihrer Analyse ist die Anzahl der Zust{\"a}nde.

Wir zeigen, wie Bounded Model Checking zur Berechnung von Gegenbeispielen f{\"u}r Markow-Ketten eingesetzt werden kann, wenn diese eine vorgegebene Sicherheitseigenschaft verletzen. Durch eine Reihe von Optimierungen gelingt es uns, sowohl die Laufzeit zu reduzieren als auch die Gr{\"o}{\ss}e der Gegenbeispiele zu verringern.

  abstract  = {FDR3 is a complete rewrite of the CSP refinement checker FDR2, incorporating a significant number of enhancements. In this paper we describe the operation of FDR3 at a high level and then give a detailed description of several of its more important innovations. This includes the new multi-core refinement-checking algorithm that is able to achieve a near linear speed up as the number of cores increase. Further, we describe the new algorithm that FDR3 uses to construct its internal representation of CSP processes---this algorithm is more efficient than FDR2's, and is able to compile a large class of CSP processes to more efficient internal representations. We also present experimental results that compare FDR3 to related tools, which show it is unique (as far as we know) in being able to scale beyond the bounds of main memory.},
